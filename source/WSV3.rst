A quick overview of the capabilities of WSV3
--------------------------------------------

Noteworthy features include but are not limited to:

#. Quality private-server-backed National Radar mosaic - 3 options, based on MRMS

#. NEXRAD Level 2 radar data including proprietary LiveScan and LiveComposite technologies

   * Derived Level 2 radial products (Velocity Dealiasing, SRV, MEHS, ET, Max Downdraft Gust, etc.)

   * Support for multiple public internet data sources for redundancy in high-demand events
   
#. NEXRAD Level 3 radar data including visual depicts of non-radial point products (storm tracks, hail icons, MESO/TVS, etc.)

#. Extensive suite of high-temporal-resolution GOES-16 satellite imagery

   * Two RGB multispectral visualizations included (True Color RGB + IR/VIS Sandwich)
   
   * 5 bands of CMIP imagery for GOES-16 CONUS
   
   * Add-on subscription adds access to full 16-band output of G16/17 Full Disk, CONUS, and MESO rapid-scan 1-minute imagery with multiple RGB multispectral products
   
#. Severe Weather tracking abilities

   * Point/path extrapolation from NWS warning objects and manual tracks
   
   * Tracking information from Level 3 radar derived storm cells
   
   * Rollover ETA storm arrival information and city time-to-impact list
   
#. NWS Severe Watche outlines and Severe Warning polygons

#. MRMS data

#. Mesoanalysis fields

#. SPC convective outlooks

#. LSR (Local Storm Report) icons

#. METAR + NDBC surface observations

#. WPC Surface Analysis

#. GOES-R GLM lightning data with add-on subscription

#. Extensive foreecast model data system

   * Defaults include all major NCEP models (GFS, NAM, HRRR, RAP, HIRESW)
   
   * 48-Hour HRRR
   
   * Customizable to add any GRIB2-format internet model data; pulls from NCEP-format HTTP servers
   
#. Tropical data layers

#. Winter weather data including WPC snow/ice accumulation probabilities

#. Highly customizable GIS/Vector rendering engine and background/terrain rendering engine for unique, brandable map appearance
