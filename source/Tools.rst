Benchmarks
----------

Once AceCAST has been downloaded, there will be a folder called benchmarks in ../AceCASTv1.2/run directory.

* It is recommended to use the test cases provided in the benchmarks directory for 
  getting started with AceCAST.
	
	* easter100:
		* 2km horizontal resolution, 100x100x51 grid, 2 days simulation initialized with HRRR
		* Very small domain intended for quick validation testing.
		* Note that this case is only for testing and should not be used for performance benchmarking due to its small domain size.
	
	* easter500:
		* 2km horizontal resolution, 500x500x51 grid, 2 days simulation initialized with HRRR
		* Larger domain intended for benchmarking on small numbers of GPUs (ex. 1-4 V100 GPUs)

	* easter1500 (not included by default):
		* 1km horizontal resolution, 1500x1500x51 grid, 1 hour simulation initialized with HRRR
		* Large, high resolution domain intended for performance benchmarking on larger numbers of GPUs (ex. 8-32 V100 GPUs)
		* You must ensure minimum 11GB space to simulate this case
		* This case is not included in the distribution package
		* download `here <https://tqi-s3bucket-testing.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/distros/easter1500.tar.gz>`_
