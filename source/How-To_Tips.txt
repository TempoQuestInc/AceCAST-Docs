TOC Tree setup in index.rst (only here can you add the toctree syntax):

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2 
   :caption: This adds a page caption

   ./Adding_A_Page
   ./Adding_Another_Page
   

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: New TOC section

   ./This_adds_a_new_TOC_section

Tips:
1.) Issue make html after finishing edits in ../AceCAST-Docs to "refresh" html files
2.) Delete doctrees file contents in ../AceCAST-Docs/build/doctrees if Website TOC is being glitchy then issue make html
3.) 9/10 times an error occured because of improper spacing
4.) Copied " ' " and " - " from MSWord sometimes show up as invalid characters and trigger an error. To resolve, just delete and type again.
