AceCAST is simply a modified implementation of the standard CPU-based WRF model distributed by NCAR (checkout the 
`wrf users page here <https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/>`_) that runs on high-performance GPUs. Our goal is to 
make AceCAST a simple and convenient alternative to running WRF on CPUs and as such have preserved as much of the
standard WRF functionality as possible. It is assumed that users are at least somewhat familiar with running the
standard WRF model prior to running AceCAST. If you are not familiar with the WRF model we suggest you explore 
the various resources provided on the WRF users page before continuing.

    `WRF Users Page <https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/>`_

This guide is intended to help existing WRF users become familiar with the mechanics of running AceCAST and how
they can take advantage of AceCAST's performance advantages to enhance their modeling capabilities.
